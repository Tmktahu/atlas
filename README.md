This is the repository for Atlas, coded by Fryke#0746 on Discord.

Atlas is a standalone, interactive 3D mapping tool for the game Starbase. This README will be updated with current features as the project is upgraded and added to.

## How to use Atlas

Atlas is a standalone application build on Electron and Vue. Download the latest executable from the [releases section](https://github.com/Tmktahu/atlas/releases) and run it wherever you want. It is a portable application, so it requires no installation.

For information on how the coordinate grid is set up, check out the [Independant Positioning System](https://github.com/Tmktahu/IPS) repository and the wiki page I've written about [The Sacred Grid](https://github.com/Tmktahu/IPS/wiki/The-Sacred-Grid).

## Locally Stored Information

All waypoint information is stored locally on your computer in the form of JSON files. By default, Atlas functions off a `waypoint_data.json` file that is created in the directory where you run `Atlas.exe`. Atlas also allows you to save your current waypoint information or import waypoints from any JSON file of your choice.

## A Note to Companies

Atlas allows users to select icons for their custom waypoints. If you are interested, I would love to add your company logo to the options. Reach out to me on Discord at Fryke#0746.

## Is this a virus?

No. You can read through the code yourself and [build it yourself](https://github.com/Tmktahu/atlas/wiki/How-To-Build) if you want. If you aren't familiar with coding shenanigans, then grab the EXE and run it through any virus scanning tool online or offline that you see fit. The executable won't do anything unless you run it, so it is 100% safe to download and analyze as you see fit.

I've also taken the liberty to upload the current Atlas version executable to several different online virus scanning utilities:

- Virus Total: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/75171d2a6bb0db461a222bc2dbfd55a923d4dbdecfe65fb0e150fd14cfe9bcee
- Jotti: https://virusscan.jotti.org/en-US/filescanjob/7vga5rrbh3
- Kaspersky: https://opentip.kaspersky.com/75171D2A6BB0DB461A222BC2DBFD55A923D4DBDECFE65FB0E150FD14CFE9BCEE/
