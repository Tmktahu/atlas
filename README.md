This is the repository for the Atlas Project, coded by Fryke#0746 on Discord.

Atlas is a standalone, interactive 3D mapping tool for the game Starbase. This README will be updated with current features as the project is upgraded and added to.

## How to use Atlas

Atlas is a standalone application build on Electron and Vue. Download the latest executable from the [releases section](https://github.com/Tmktahu/atlas/releases) and run it wherever you want. It is a portable application, so it requires no installation.

For information on how the coordinate grid is set up, check out the [Independant Positioning System](https://github.com/Tmktahu/IPS) repository and the wiki page I've written about [The Sacred Grid](https://github.com/Tmktahu/IPS/wiki/The-Sacred-Grid).

## Locally Stored Information

All waypoint information is stored locally on your computer in the form of JSON files. By default, Atlas functions off a `waypoint_data.json` file that is created in the directory where you run `Atlas.exe`. Atlas also allows you to save your current waypoint information or import waypoints from any JSON file of your choice.
