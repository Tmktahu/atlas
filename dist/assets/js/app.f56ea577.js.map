{\n      console.log('Converting from SIGNA to IPS');\n      // left = SIGNA, right = IPS\n\n      /*\n        So he defines the Signa grid as\n        - East = [0, 0, 0]\n        - East => West is the +X-axis\n        - North is +Y direction\n\n\n\n      His steps to convert are weird. I can derive them myself.\n\n      // First we take the input coordinate and perform a series of rotations on it to bring it in line with our grid.\n\n      // To define those rotations, we need to define the angles we need to cover\n      // We can do this easily since we have the coordinates for everything in our own space.\n\n      // East = { x: -20000, y: -60000, z: 0 }\n      // West = { x: -5000, y: 60000, z: 0 }\n\n      Vector from East to West = [15000, 120000, 0]\n      Angle from EW (+X) to IPS +X-axis = 76.96 degrees\n\n      so Rotation #1 = rotation around the Y axis by 76.96 degrees counter-clockwise (grid-wise)\n\n\n      Next, we need to pull the Y axis to be in line with ours.\n      So we need to calculate the angle between our Y axis and his.\n      Signa Y axis is defined as the North direction.\n      North rests on a Y of 0, that means we should be able to just flat out rotate everything 90 degrees\n\n      so Rotation #2 = rotation around the X axis by 90 degrees clockwise (grid wise)\n\n\n      And then finally we need to make one more rotation to fix the Z axis.\n      At this point, Y is perfectly aligned, but X and Z are off.\n      Because rotation #2 was a 90 degree rotation, this third rotation will also be around the Y axis.\n\n      We need to define the Z direction, which is a perpendicular line from Eest=>West to North\n      In this case, we don't care about the X component.\n\n      // North = { x: 20000, y: 0, z: 65000 }\n\n      midpont between east and west is [-12500, 0, 0]\n\n      then we get the vector from the midpoint to north\n      mid=>North = [32500, 0, 65000]\n\n      THAT is our Z direction, and after the first 2 rotations that should properly represent the currently rotated Z axis\n      So now we get the angle\n\n      Angle = 26.565 degrees\n\n      so Rotation #3 = rotation around the Y axis by 26.565 degrees counterclockwise (grid-wise)\n\n\n\n      // After all 3 rotations, we should end up with the coordinate of the point on a correctly rotated grid assuming that East is 0,0,0\n\n\n\n      //////////////////////// using wolfram alpha\n      Starting Coordinate = [x0, y0, z0]\n      Rotation #1 = [x1 = 0.2256(x0) - 0.97421(z0), y0, z1 = 0.97421(x0) + 0.2256(z0)] // 76.96 degrees around Y-axis \"clockwise\"\n      Rotation #2 = [x1, y1 = z1, z2 = -y0] // 90 degress around the X-axis \"clockwise\"\n      Rotation #3 = [x2 = 0.89443(x1) + 0.4472(z2), y1, z3 = 0.89443(z2) - 0.4472(x1)] // 26.565 degrees around the Y-axis \"clockwise\"\n\n      Now we can smush things together\n\n      xr = x2 = 0.89443(x1)\n      xr = 0.89443(x1)\n      xr = 0.89443(0.2256(x0) - 0.97421(z0))\n\n      yr = y1\n      yr = z1\n      yr = 0.97421(x0) + 0.2256(z0)\n\n      zr = z3 = 0.89443(z2) - 0.4472(x1)\n      zr = 0.89443(z2) - 0.4472(x1)\n      zr = 0.89443(-y0) - 0.4472(x1)\n      zr = 0.89443(-y0) - 0.4472(0.2256(x0) - 0.97421(z0))\n\n      */\n\n      // let x1 = 0.2256 * this.inputLeftX + 0.97421 * this.inputLeftZ;\n      // let y1 = this.inputLeftY;\n      // let z1 = 0.2256 * this.inputLeftZ - 0.97421 * this.inputLeftX;\n\n      // let x2 = 0.89443 * x1 + 0.4472 * y1;\n      // let y2 = 0.89443 * y1 - 0.4472 * x1;\n      // let z2 = z1;\n\n      // Now we have a coordinate as if East were [0, 0, 0], so correction is easy.\n\n      // Signa [0, 0, 0] should equal IPS [-20000, -60000, 0]\n      // Signa [120933.866224, 0, 0] should equal IPS [-5000, 60000, 0]\n\n      //8x - y - 4z + 100000 = 0\n      // normal vector = [8, -1, -4] <= this is the direction of the +z axis before rotations in IPS coords\n\n      // now what we do, is we take our X-axis [1, 0, 0] and project it onto [8, -1, -4],\n      //  which gives us the 'vertical component' of [1, 0, 0] relative to the W/E/N plane.\n\n      //https://www.emathhelp.net/calculators/linear-algebra/vector-projection-calculator/?u=8%2C-1%2C-4&v=1%2C0%2C0\n\n      // projected vector = [65/81, -8/81, -32/81] = [0.790123456790123, −0.098765432098765, −0.395061728395062]\n\n      // Then we subtract that vertical component from [1, 0, 0] to get the projection of [1, 0, 0] onto the plane\n      // projected IPS X-axis = [1, 0, 0] - [0.790123456790123, −0.098765432098765, −0.395061728395062] = [0.209876543209877, 0.098765432098765, 0.395061728395062]\n      //  now this is the IPS X-axis vector projected onto the Signa XY-plane in IPS coordinates.\n      //  so now we want to compare this projected vector to the E=>W Signa X-axis (in IPS coords)\n      //  Then we perform rotation #1 so that the IPS X-axis rests on the Signa XZ-plane\n\n      // projected IPS X-axis = [0.209876543209877, 0.098765432098765, 0.395061728395062]\n      // E=>W Signa X-axis = [15000, 120000, 0]\n      // Angle Between = 74.29 degrees   /// NOTE how this differs from the one before.
